    """Compute the geometric affinity between two geometries.

    This function calculates the geometric similarity between two input
    geometries in the context of time-frequency space. The geometric affinity
    metric indicates how similar the two geometries are, with a value ranging
    from 0 (no similarity) to 1 (perfect similarity).

    Parameters
    ----------
    geometry1
        The first geometry to be compared.
    geometry2
        The second geometry to be compared.
    time_buffer
        Time buffer for geometric preparation. Default is 0.01.
    freq_buffer
        Frequency buffer for geometric preparation. Default is 100.

    Returns
    -------
    affinity: float
        A metric indicating the geometric similarity between the input
        geometries.

        - 0: The geometries have no overlap
        - 1: The geometries perfectly overlap.

        The value is a ratio of the intersection area to the union area of the
        two geometries.

    Notes
    -----
    - 0 or 1-dimensional geometries are buffered to 2-dimensional using
    the specified time and frequency buffers.
    - If either input geometry is of a time-based type, a specialized
    time-based affinity calculation is performed.
    - The function utilizes the Shapely library for geometric operations.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> geometry1 = data.Geometry(...)  # Define the first geometry
    >>> geometry2 = data.Geometry(...)  # Define the second geometry
    >>> affinity = compute_affinity(
    ...     geometry1,

    ...     time_buffer=0.02,
    ...     freq_buffer=150,
