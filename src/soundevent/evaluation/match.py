    """Match geometries.

    This function matches geometries from a source and target sequence.
    The geometries are matched based on their affinity, which is computed
    using the compute_affinity function. The final matches are then
    selected to maximize the total affinity between the source and target
    geometries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : Sequence[Geometry]
        Source geometries.
    target : Sequence[Geometry]
        Target geometries.

    Returns
    -------
    Sequence[Tuple[Optional[int], Optional[int], float]]
        A sequence of matches. Each match is a tuple of the source index,
        target index and affinity. If a source geometry is not matched to
        any target geometry, the target index is None. If a target geometry
        is not matched to any source geometry, the source index is None.
        Every source and target geometry is matched exactly once.
