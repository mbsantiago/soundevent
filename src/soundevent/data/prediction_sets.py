"""Prediction Set.

In bioacoustic research, it is common to apply the same processing pipeline to
a set of audio clips, such as all the clips in a dataset or a test set. To
maintain a reference to this group of processed clips and the specific
processing method used, the concept of a `ModelRun` is introduced. A `ModelRun`
represents a collection of processed clips that were generated in a single run
using the same processing method.

## Ensuring Consistency and Comparability

By organizing processed clips into `ModelRun` objects, researchers can ensure
that all clips within a run were analyzed in the same exact manner. This
guarantees consistency and comparability when comparing results across
different runs or when evaluating against other groups of annotations.

## Grouping Processed Clips

A `ModelRun` serves as a container for a set of processed clips that share a
common processing method. It provides a convenient way to organize and manage
the processed clips generated during a single run.

## Tracking Processing Method

The `ModelRun` object keeps track of the specific processing method that was
applied to generate the processed clips. This information is crucial for
reproducing and replicating the results, as well as for accurately documenting
the processing pipeline.

## Comparative Analysis and Evaluation

`ModelRun` objects facilitate comparative analysis and evaluation of different
processing methods or runs. Researchers can easily compare the results and
performance of various models, algorithms, or parameter settings by examining
the processed clips within each `ModelRun`.

        The unique identifier of the model run, automatically generated upon

    clips
        A list of `ProcessedClip` instances representing the audio clips
        processed during the run. These clips share a common processing history
