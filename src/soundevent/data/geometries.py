"""Geometry types.

Sound event geometry plays a crucial role in locating and describing
sound events within a recording. Different geometry types offer
flexibility in representing the location of sound events, allowing for
varying levels of detail and precision. The soundevent package follows
the GeoJSON specification for geometry types and provides support for
a range of geometry types.

## Units and Time Reference

All geometries in the soundevent package utilize seconds as the unit
for time and hertz as the unit for frequency. It is important to note
that time values are always relative to the start of the recording. By
consistently using these units, it becomes easier to develop functions
and interact with geometry objects based on convenient assumptions.

## Supported Geometry Types

The soundevent package supports the following geometry types, each
serving a specific purpose in describing the location of sound events:

* TimeStamp: Represents a single point in time.

* TimeInterval: Describes a time interval, indicating a range of time
within which the sound event occurs.

* Point: Represents a specific point in time and frequency,
pinpointing the exact location of the sound event.

* LineString: Represents a sequence of points in time and frequency,
allowing for the description of continuous sound events.

* Polygon: Defines a closed shape in time and frequency, enabling the
representation of complex sound event regions.

* Box: Represents a rectangle in time and frequency, useful for
specifying rectangular sound event areas.

* Multi-Point: Describes a collection of points, allowing for the
representation of multiple sound events occurring at different
locations.

* Multi-Line String: Represents a collection of line strings, useful
for capturing multiple continuous sound events.

* Multi-Polygon: Defines a collection of polygons, accommodating
complex and overlapping sound event regions.

By offering these geometry types, the soundevent package provides a
comprehensive framework for accurately and flexibly describing the
location and extent of sound events within a recording.

    The `BaseGeometry` class serves as the foundation for various geometrical
    representations used in sound event localization. It provides a consistent
    structure for handling geometric objects and ensures synchronization with
    Shapely geometry objects. Instances of classes derived from `BaseGeometry`
    represent different types of spatial entities and facilitate accurate
    localization of sound events within audio data.

    Attributes
    ----------
    type
        The type of geometry used to locate the sound event. This attribute is
        essential for categorizing and identifying the specific geometric
        representation employed, such as points, polygons, or circles.
    coordinates
        The coordinates of the geometry. Depending on the geometry type, this
        attribute can represent a single pair of coordinates (for points) or a

        Properly structured coordinates are crucial for accurately defining the
        spatial extent of the geometry.

    Notes
    -----
        Mutation of geometry objects is not allowed. This restriction ensures
        that the geometry object remains immutable and always in sync with the

    """MultiPolygon Geometry Class.

    The `MultiPolygon` class represents sound events within an audio recording,
    defined by multiple polygons in both time and frequency. This geometry type
    is suitable for events that are split into multiple distinct polygons,
    often due to occlusion by other sound events. `MultiPolygon` enables the
    identification and mapping of multiple separate regions within an event,
    providing a detailed representation for complex acoustic patterns, such as
    events occluded by others.

    Attributes
    ----------
    type
        The type of geometry, always set to "MultiPolygon," indicating the
        specific geometry type being utilized. This attribute ensures clear
        identification of the geometry representation and its intended purpose.
    coordinates
        The polygons of the sound event, specifying the time and frequency
        coordinates for each point in each polygon within the event. The
        `coordinates` attribute is represented as a list of lists of lists of
        lists, where each innermost list contains two float values representing
        the time and frequency of a point. All times are relative to the start
        of the recording. This format allows for the localization of multiple
        distinct regions within the recording.

"""Geometry Type.

The Geometry type is a versatile data structure designed to pinpoint sound
events accurately within audio recordings. It encompasses a range of geometric
representations, each tailored to specific use cases within bioacoustic
research. These geometries play a fundamental role in describing the spatial
and temporal characteristics of sound events, enabling precise analysis and
interpretation.

Available Geometries:

* `TimeStamp`: Represents a sound event located at a specific point in time.
* `TimeInterval`: Describes a sound event within a specified time interval.
* `Point`: Locates a sound event at a precise time and frequency point.
* `LineString`: Defines a sound event as a trajectory in time and frequency.
* `Polygon`: Represents a complex shape in time and frequency, enclosing a
    sound event.
* `BoundingBox`: Describes a sound event within a defined time and frequency
    range.
* `MultiPoint`: Represents multiple discrete points in time and frequency as a
    single sound event.
* `MultiLineString`: Describes a sound event formed by multiple connected
    trajectories.
* `MultiPolygon`: Represents a sound event encompassed by multiple complex
    shapes.
