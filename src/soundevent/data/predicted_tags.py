"""Predicted tags.

In the realm of audio analysis, machine-learning-based methods often
generate categorical descriptions of processed sound clips. These
descriptions, here defined as predicted tags, serve to capture the
output of these methods. However, in many cases, these methods operate
using probabilistic models, resulting in the assignment of probability
scores that measure the confidence of the tag assignment.

## Probability Scores

Predicted tags not only represent categorical descriptions but also
carry vital information in the form of probability scores. These scores
reflect the degree of confidence associated with the tag assignment.
Ranging from 0 to 1, a score of 1 signifies a high level of certainty in
the assigned tag. It is worth noting that in cases where the audio
analysis method does not provide a score, the score is set to 1 as a
default value.

By incorporating probability scores into predicted tags, machine
learning-based audio analysis methods provide insights into the
confidence level of the assigned tags. Researchers can leverage this
information to assess the reliability and accuracy of the predicted
tags, facilitating further analysis and evaluation of the audio data.

    Predicted tags are categorical descriptions generated by machine
    learning-based methods to represent processed sound clips. These
    descriptions include probability scores, reflecting the confidence of the

    analysis, providing insights into the characteristics of sound events.

    Attributes
    ----------
    tag
        The predicted tag representing the categorical description of the sound event.
    score
        A probability score ranging from 0 to 1, indicating the confidence
        level of the tag assignment. A score of 1 signifies a high level of
        certainty in the assigned tag. When the audio analysis method does not
        provide a score, the default value is set to 1.
