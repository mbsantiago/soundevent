"""Evaluated Example Module.

The `EvaluatedExample` class within the `soundevent.data` package represents a
specific example that has been evaluated by a machine learning model in the
context of bioacoustic analysis. This class contains detailed information about
the evaluation process, including the original `EvaluationExample`, the model's
predictions (`ProcessedClip`), matches between predicted and ground truth
annotations (`Match` instances), and computed evaluation metrics.

    Attributes
    ----------
    annotations
        An instance of the `ClipAnnotations` class representing the original
        annotations for the evaluated example. This object contains the audio
        clip, ground truth annotations, and other relevant information
        necessary for evaluation.
    prediction
        An instance of the `ProcessedClip` class representing the model's
        predictions for the given example. This processed clip encapsulates the
        model's annotations and predictions, providing a standardized format
        for comparison and analysis.
    matches
        A list of `Match` instances representing the matches between the
        model's predictions and the ground truth annotations. Each `Match`
        object contains information about the predicted and actual annotations
        that align, allowing for detailed analysis of correct predictions and
        potential errors.
    metrics
        A list of `Feature` instances representing computed evaluation metrics
        for the evaluated example. These metrics quantify the model's
        performance on this specific instance, offering numerical insights into
        accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant evaluation criteria.
    score
        A float representing the overall score for the evaluated example. This
        score is usually some combination of the evaluation metrics, providing
        a single value that can be used to compare different models and
        evaluation examples. Can be used to rank predictions based on their
        overall score
