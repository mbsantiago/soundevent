# Data Module

The `soundevent.data` module contains a collection of data classes specifically
designed for working with sound events in the field of bioacoustic research.
These data classes are built using
[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), a library that offers robust
validation and typing support.

## Purpose and Functionality

The primary objective of the `soundevent.data` module is to provide clearly
defined and standardized objects that facilitate the handling and manipulation
of sound events. These objects are designed to be reusable and serve as building
blocks for constructing complex analysis pipelines and workflows within the
bioacoustic software community.

## Key Features

- Validation: The data classes in this module enforce data validation, ensuring
  that the input adheres to the defined structure and constraints. This helps
  maintain data integrity and reliability throughout the analysis process.

- [Typing Support](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html): The data
  classes incorporate type annotations, enabling developers to leverage the
  benefits of static typing. Clear and consistent typing promotes code clarity,
  readability, and facilitates integration with other libraries and tools.

By utilizing the data classes provided in the `soundevent.data` module,
researchers and developers can work with well-defined and validated objects,
fostering reproducibility and efficient collaboration in bioacoustic research
endeavors.
