# Soundevent Data Schemas

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of bioacoustic analysis with the `soundevent` package! ðŸŽµ
This package brings you a collection of data schemas designed to be the backbone
of your computational bioacoustics analysis. Whether you're a seasoned Python
developer or a curious bioacoustics enthusiast, these schemas aim to make your
life simpler.

## What is a schema?

Let's start with the basics. A schema is like the blueprint for your data. It's
a formal way of specifying how data is structured, allowing you to clearly
define what data objects hold and how they store it.

    Schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/about#what-is-a-schema).

## Why should you care?

Now, let's discuss why these data schemas matter to us bioacousticians:

1. **Teamwork**: Shared schemas mean everyone's on the same page. When everyone
   follows the same rules, collaboration and tool compatibility become much
   smoother.

2. **Quality Check**: Ever wished for an easy way to identify errors in your
   data? Schemas make it happen. They enable you to check an object against the
   schema, validating if the data has everything it needs and is correct.

3. **Enhanced developer experience**: Python is entering the era of Type hints.
   Using these hints makes your code more robust, acting like guardrails to
   ensure that your data follows the rules.
